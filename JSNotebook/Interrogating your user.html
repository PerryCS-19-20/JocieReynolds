    <p><em>What I learned today was how to code so that the computer can ask the user questions. The computer can ask three different types of questions.The first type of question can have any response. This variable uses readLine. The second type is asking questions that have  number as a response. These uses readInt and will only take number responses from the users. The last question that the computer can ask is true or false questions or yes no statements. This questions uses readBoolean. Now that the computer has asked all these you need to write the code for the computer to print out the response. </em></p>
