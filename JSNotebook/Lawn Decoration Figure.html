For this assignment, you will add a page to your JavaScript Notebook that draws a pretty picture.

There is a template below, add it to a new file in your JSNotebook folder in NetBeans, then link to it from the JSNotebook index.html.

<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>      
    <link href="https://perryma.tk/jsnotebook/notebook.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />    
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <title>My JavaScript Notebook</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <div class="header">
        <!-- Title for this notebook page -->
        <h1>My JavaScript Notebook: <em>Graphics Objects</em></h1>
        <div class="menubar"></div>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Describe what this notebook page is showing -->
    <p><em>What I learned today is how to add shapes into documents. I learned how to prepare the canvas and write code so that the computer will draw out the correct graphic. The two shapes that were explored in this chapter were the rectangle and the circle. For both images a variable is setup with the shapes cordinates.
            The rectangle has the x and y points and a height and width that need to be set while the circle has a radius value instead of height and width. After setting the shape up you can set the color of the shape. Afterwards you have to add the image to the canvas and then tell the it to draw the shape. 
        You can use math commands to make the shapes certain sizes and proportions and make the width and height the same sizes as the canvas. This module talked about if statements. These statements as a user about a statement and if that statement is correct then the computer will do some function. IF that function is not correct then the computer will do something else. 
        This funtion is known as the if else fuction. These tell the computer if some condition is met then do this action, but if the condition is not met then do this other action.</em></p>
