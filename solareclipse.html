        <h1> Solar Eclipse</h1>
        <h3> What are Solar Elcipses</h3>
        <h4> A solar eclipse is when the moon is directly infront of the sun and blocks all possible sunlight. Solar eclipse occur when the earth, moon, and sun are aligned with each other in a straight line. 
        The only time this can happen is when there is a new moon. The last time there was a solar eclipse was back in 1979. The next solar eclipse will occur on August 21, 2017.
            Being able to see a solar eclipse on your life time is rare and unique.

        <h3> How Can You View The Solar Eclipse?</h3>
        <h4> Many people will be able to see this solar eclipse that is coming up. Acutually anyone living in North America is lucky enoguh to see this event. Now you have to be careful and know what you are looking at.
        There is a Center line that runs throught 10 States. If you are on the center line you will experience a total eclipse. The total eclipse only last for 2 minutes and 40 seconds. If you are not located on the center line then you will be viewing a particla eclipse.
        </h4>
        <h3> Types Of Elcipses</h3>
        <h4> There are many different types of eclispe that occur and that can be seen</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Lunar Elipse
                <ul>
                    <li class="type">Total Lunar Eclipse</li>
                        <ul><li> When The sun, earth and moon are alighned to form almost a straight line</li></ul>
                     <li  class="type">Partial Lunar Eclipse</li>
                        <ul><li> When this occurs the part of the moon is covered by the shadow of the earth </li></ul>
                    <li class="type" > Penumbral Eclipse</li>
                        <ul><li> This is a rare type of eclipse. This type of eclipse occurs when Earth blocks the sun's light from reaching the moon</li></ul>
                </ul>
            </li>
                
            <li> Solar Elcipse
                <ul>
                    <li class="type"> Total Solar Eclipse</li>
                        <ul><li>This is when the moon completely blocks the sun from Earth's view </li></ul>
                    <li class="type" > Partical Total Eclipse</li>
                        <ul><li> Just like a partial lunar eclispe a partial solar eclipse is when the moon only blocks part of the sun form Earth</li></ul>
                    <li class="type" >Annular Solar Eclipse</li>
                        <ul><li> This is when the moon appears smaller than the sun and a bright ring  of sunlight is visible</li></ul>
                    <li  class="type">Hybrid Solar Eclipse </li>
                        <ul><li>A hybrid solar eclipse is unique and rare. When one occurs the eclipse changes from a annular solar eclipse to a total solar eclipse muliple times throughout its path</li></ul>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3> How to View A Solar Eclipse</h3>
        <h4> When the moon blocks the sun during a solar eclipse the sun's outter  atmosphere will be visable to the naked eye.The light may look cool but can be damaging to the eye.
        In order to see the total eclipse you can either wear solar-viewing glasses to proctect the eye, or you can use a pinhole camera. One can easily make a pinhole camera at home. 
        This is a safe way to view the eclipse because whne using the pinhole one is not looking directly at the sunlight they are looking at a projection of the sun and moon.</h4>
